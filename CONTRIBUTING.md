## Contribution Guidelines
- **Be respectful & inclusive.** Assume good intent and keep discussions constructive.
- **Small, focused PRs.** One logical change per pull request.
- **Follow style.** Use clear names, add comments where helpful, and keep functions small.
- **Accessibility first.** Prefer semantic HTML, labels, keyboard navigation, and ARIA where needed.
- **Tests (when applicable).** Include or update tests for new/changed behavior.
- **Docs.** Update README or inline docs when behavior changes.


## How to Contribute
1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature` (or `fix/…`).
3. **Make your changes** following our guidelines and run the app locally to verify.
4. **Commit** with clear messages: `feat: add printable receipt view`.
5. **Push** to your fork and **open a Pull Request (PR)** against `main`.
6. **Link issues** your PR resolves (e.g., `Fixes #12`).


## Reporting Issues
- Use the GitHub **Issues** tab.
- Provide a **clear title**, **steps to reproduce**, **expected vs. actual behavior**, and **screenshots** or **console logs** when possible.
- Add appropriate **labels** (bug, enhancement, docs, discussion).


## Suggesting Features
- Before opening a new feature request, **search existing issues**.
- Explain the **problem**, not just the solution. Describe **use cases**, **benefits**, and any **alternatives** considered.
- Mockups or rough sketches are welcome.


## Code of Conduct
We follow a simple rule: **be kind**. Harassment, discrimination, and disrespectful behavior aren’t tolerated. Treat everyone with professionalism and empathy. If you experience or witness violations, please report them via an issue or privately to a maintainer.


## Review Process
- A maintainer will review your PR for **correctness**, **scope**, **readability**, **accessibility**, and **impact**.
- You may receive review comments. Please **respond constructively** and **update** your PR.
- Once approved, your PR will be **squash-merged** (unless otherwise requested) to keep history tidy.
- CI checks (if configured) must pass before merge.
